## Variable Bitrate Neural Fields

**Code is coming soon. Specifically it will be out by the SIGGRAPH conference!!**

This is the official code repository for [Variable Bitrate Neural Fields (SIGGRAPH 2022)](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vbnf) which compresses feature grids for neural fields using our method, VQ-AD (vector-quantized auto-decoder).
