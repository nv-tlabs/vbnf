## Variable Bitrate Neural Fields

**Code is now available:** https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin-wisp

We will eventually populate this repository with scripts and additional code for the various small experiments. Stay tuned!

This is the official code repository for [Variable Bitrate Neural Fields (SIGGRAPH 2022)](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vqad) which compresses feature grids for neural fields using our VQ-AD (vector-quantized auto-decoder) method.
